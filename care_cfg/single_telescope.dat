#How many telescopes need to trigger for an array trigger.
#A multiplicity of 1 is equivalent to having no array trigger.
* TELMULTIPLICITY 1

#Require next neighbour telescope trigger; yes = 1, no = 0
* TELNEXTNEIGHBOR 0

#Coincidence window between telescopes in ns
* ARRAYCOINCIDENCE 50

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Array configuration
#   Parameters for each telescope (TLCFG) the parameters are:
#   -the telescope identification number in the CARE simulations 
#   -the telescopes ID in the hyperarray (for CTA) is the same as tel id if all telescopes are used
#   -the telescope type
#   -the sigma of the electronic noise in units of the single pe amplitude for a relative telescope gain of one.
#    A sigma of 0 means no electronic noise #AP: 10% of electronic noise
#   -the relative gain of the telescope #AP: for now everything they are equivalent...
#   -the Winston Cone efficiency can be modified to adjust 
#    the total optical throughput of that specific telescope
#    #AP estimated with './winston_cone_average.py cta_funnels.dat -l funnels_borofilter540nm.dat'
#   -the sigma by which the optical psf is blured [mm]
#    Add additional bluring of optical PSF. The position of the photon will be reevaluated by adding
#    a random shift  x = x + 1/sqrt(2 pi sigma^2)e(-x_rand^2/(2sigma^2) and the same in y
#    the sigma of the Gaussians in mm by which the optical PSF should be blured in addition
#    if the sigma is <=0 no blurring is used
#    #AP: Unknown addictional blurring. IT MUST STILL BE STUDIED!
