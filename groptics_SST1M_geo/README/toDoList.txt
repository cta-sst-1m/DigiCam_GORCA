ToDo list
1. don't require an input photon file with using TESTTEL and DRAWTEL
2. finish doxygen code documentation (underway)
3. finish first draft of UsersGuide and DevelopersGuide
4. set up pilot record for use of TPolyLine3D photon traces 
5. add commandLine -h option (Done 7/16)
6. add correct verion number in GDefinition.h (Done 7/16)
7. recheck telescope printing options 
8. take out cameraRadius record in geo pilot file.
9. separate draw telescope records for DC and SC telescopes
   since they can have different options. Add facet drawings
   to DC telescope drawer.
10. valgrind/alleyoop to remove memory leaks (Done 9/29)
11. change deletes to SafeDelete's  / rerun valgrind (Done 9/29)
12. determine memory usage (Done 9/28: 18 MB/telescopeSCorDC)
13. facet number in editrecords start at 0 rather than 1 while
    telescope numbers start at 1. Change facet numbering to 1...
    May be easier to have defaults for reflectivity curve and for 
    degradation factor - as is if no entries. Then easier to change
    blur radius only.
