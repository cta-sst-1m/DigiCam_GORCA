  version: 6.1.0    date: 2014-05-06
   makePhotonsOffset.cpp produces a grisudet compatible .cph file 
   of cherenkov photons offset from a specified primary direction. 
   The photons are randomly placed on the telescope area with  
   radius increased by 10%.  Telescope locations and radii are from 
   a standard GrISU telescope configuration file. The code has 
   a ROOT dependency. All input information designated by this pilot file.

   All log information goes to cerr.

   Testing of this code is straightforward using a photon_history debug
   file (see the DEBUG record in detector.pilot). This history file may
   be converted to a root tree in GrISU/Utilities/Diagnostics.

   usage:  makePhotonsOffset [name of pilotfile: default makePhotonsPtSrc.pilot]

   Coor.System: ground X(East), Y(North), Z(up). When pointing to zenith
   as is always the case here, the telescope axes are parallel to these
   ground coordinate axes.  The camera axes are slightly different, camera
   X axis is parallel to the telescope x axis; the camera y axis is
   opposite to the telescope y axis (thus permitting x camera to the right and y
   camera up when facing the camera with telescope in stow position).
