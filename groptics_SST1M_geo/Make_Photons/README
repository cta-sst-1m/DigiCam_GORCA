see the pilot files for more documentation

usage: using the repository makePhotonsOffset.pilot
       
          make
          makePhotonsOffset

to create the veritasStarOffset.cph file containing 500,000 photons on each
of the 4 veritas telescopes. Telescope locations and radii are in the
../Config/veritas.cfg file.  Note that as specified in the
makePhotonsOffset.pilot, the photons all are incident from the zenith with
no wobble offset.  

Use veritasStarOffset.cph as the input file to grOptics (set the filename
in the main grOptics pilot file). From the
photonhistory files, you, for example, can plot from the treeviewer:
    facet hits: facetX vs facetY where reflectFlag>0 (successful facet
    reflections or onFacetFlag > 0 (on facet hits).  

From the photonLocation.root file, a good plot to check the facet
orientation is photonDcosX vs photonDcosY.  These direction cosines
describe the direction of the reflected photon (on its way to the camera).

You can also compare the above plots with the shadowing on and with the
shadowing off to see the effect of shadowing and to test the shadowing geometry.

------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll make this code easier to use over the next month and will make the
documentation specific to GrOptics rather than to GrISU. In the meanwhile,
the code is easy to use provided that you:

    Make sure the telescope locations are the same in both the array
    configuration file and the Davies-Cotton configuration file. 

    Make sure that the number of telescope record in the DC configuration
    file is correct.
