Only records with an initial "*" are active.

The VGA_ReadDCStdGrISU reader creates standard telescopes for use with the 
DCTelescope factory. The reader uses a standard
GrISU configuration file to make standard telescopes based on 
instructions given in TELSTD records, each of which specifies a
telescope from the GrISU configuration file for creating the 
standard telescope.  

The DC factory will produce a DC Telescope based on a given DC standard 
telescope (see the arrayConfig.cfg file). Each individual array 
telescope may be edited from edit records in the arrayConfig.cfg file.

Telescope standard selection record
  - standard telescope id number. Must be >0, but does not
      have to be sequential nor start from 1.
  - telescope number in GrISU configuration file (see below)
  - standard geometry number. The geometry specification is
    not part of GrISU config.file (see following PILOTF record)
  - ray-tracing algorithm number 
        - 0: root structural shadowing turned off
        - 1: shadowing as in grisudet (uses ROOT only for structural shadowing)
  - average transit time in nsec (from the telescope plane to camera for photons
    normally incident on the telescope plane.
  - print option for this standard telescope
     0:  no printing
     1:  print summary information
     2:  add geometry details 
     3:  add facet details

Camera radius record 
  - standard telescope number
  - camera radius in mm 
    for VERITAS camera Rmax for pixel position is 357.58 mm, 
    pixel radius is 14.00 mm. so 375.00 mm is the camera radius
    including the camera restricts the photon locations to lie within this radius on
    the camera plane.  If left out, all photons striking the camera plane extended
    across the entire base of the focus box will be recorded in the root file.

define a plate scale factor for use only producing psf test plots in minutes
of arc on the camera. The factor is not used in the ray tracing! 
PLATESCALE <STANDARD TEL NUMBER> <CM/DEG>: 
platescale normally = tan(1degree) * (focalLength in meters) * 100
or here pscale = 0.01746 * 5.6 * 100.0 = 20.9461    
Default: code calculates platescale per above expression.

GRIDF defines an ordered hash table for fast searches for facet hits.
The hash table is a 2D grid that is either produced by the code or read
from a file. There is normally a separate grid for each standard telescope. 
However, if the telescopes all have the same dimensions and the same facet
structure, you can use option 2 for standard 1, option 3 for the remaining
standards, and use the same filename for all standards (as I have done here).
     - standard telescope number
     - gridFlag
         0, no grid, full facet/pixel loop 
    	 1, make grid and use grid in facet search
    	 2, made grid and write to filename:
       	   in later searches read this file rather than calculating 
       	   the grid (to be implemented soon) 
         3, read grid if file is available, else make and write grid
     - nbinsx, number of bins in the x direction
     - nbinsy, number of bins in the y direction
     - fileName, name of grid file (for either reading or writing)
Default (no GRIDF record) do full loop sequentially over all facets.
